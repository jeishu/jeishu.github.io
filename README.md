I wanted to inplement a [Copy Button](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50795042/create-a-copy-button-without-an-input-text-box) for my email on my website, so with the help of this Stack Overflow forum, I was able to do it.

I had my inspiration for my website from this developer, [Mengdi](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/best-ui-portfolios/). The website is down, but from the pictures, I had enough ideas to make it mine.

The skills icons are from the [Flaticons](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/pixel-perfect).

The horizontal scroll for desktop is using this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOXl6KH2N8Y) as reference. The actual horizontal scrolling with mouse wheel is done thanks to this developer's website, [Edd Turtle](https://designedbyaturtle.com/horizontal-scrolling-with-jquery/), which is based off of [Brandon Aaron](https://github.com/brandonaaron)'s code. This part of the code was pretty tricky, so I had to combined it with [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_window.asp)'s help. 

## Contributors

This code was written by me with some help of the Stack Overflow forum. My teacher's assistant, Sean, helped me figure out a the problem with horizontal scrolling.
